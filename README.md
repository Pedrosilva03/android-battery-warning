# Custom Very Low Battery Warning For Android

## Definition
Custom warning for when an android phone is about to shutdown for low battery

## Features
- For now it is just a white screen with no meaningful interactions, still it needs to be running (can be minimized, just not fuly closed)
- Runs in the background, monitoring the battery level
- If the battery is at 1% it will trigger a popup
- Notifies the user to open the app after a system reboot

## Disclaimer
- This was mostly made for fun and to explore a bit the world of android apps, which means this app is not polished and might have bugs.
- No I will not upload it to play store
- Might add some other features in the future
